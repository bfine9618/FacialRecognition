# FacialRecognition

This is a lab I completed for my Signal and Infomation Processing course (ESE 224). 
The goal of this lab is to recognize faces reguardless or orientation or lighting. This was done using a principle component transformation
and analysis. The matching was done by implementing a fairly rudimentary KNN algorithm.
